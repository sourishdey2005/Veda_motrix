# **App Name**: AI Data Science Toolkit

## Core Features:

- Toolkit Download: Offer free downloads of .exe and .msi installers for the AI and Data Science Toolkit.
- Feature Showcase: Showcase value by detailing the software suite with pre-configured data science, AI and Machine learning tools optimized for CPU systems, including but not limited to Anaconda, VS Code, Tableau and KNIME.
- Educational Resource: Establish the toolkit's purpose by explicitly describing it as a free, CPU-based tool suite built for educational purposes and practice, targeted towards students and professionals learning AI, Machine Learning and data science without needing dedicated GPUs.
- GitHub Integration: Link to GitHub repository, enabling users to contribute and fostering a community around the toolkit.
- System Checker Tool: Use an AI tool to allow the user to pre-emptively check if their system meets the minimal system requirements of the application prior to commencing the download.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cyber purple (#7A00FF) for a futuristic and innovative feel, representing the cutting-edge nature of AI and data science.
- Background color: Deep navy (#0A0E1F) to create a modern, professional, and dark mode environment, enhancing visual appeal and reducing eye strain.
- Accent color: Neon blue (#00FFFF) to highlight key elements, calls to action, and important information, providing a vibrant contrast and drawing user attention.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for bold headlines to maintain a modern and fashionable look and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure clarity and readability, especially in longer content blocks.
- Employ minimal line icons from Lucide/Feather for a clean, tech-forward aesthetic. These icons should visually represent various toolkit features and data science concepts in a non-distracting manner.
- Implement a clean, well-structured layout with clear sections. Ensure responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for optimal user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations using Framer Motion or CSS transitions to add a touch of interactivity and engagement. These should be used to highlight key features and provide feedback during user interactions (e.g., glowing hover effects on buttons).
